# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `dev/specs/features/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

[Gates determined based on constitution file - include checks for:]

- **Privacy & Data Minimization (Principle IX)**: Does this feature collect, transmit, or store user data? If yes, justify necessity and confirm local-only storage in `~/.safedownload/`.
- **Security Posture (Principle X)**: Does this feature involve network requests, credential handling, or file operations? If yes, confirm HTTPS-only, checksum verification, and no credential logging.
- **Accessibility (Principle XI)**: Does this feature add TUI elements or CLI output? If yes, confirm high-contrast support, colorblind-safe indicators, and screen-reader compatibility.
- **Optional Dependencies (Principle II)**: Does this feature require new dependencies? If yes, confirm they are optional with graceful fallback.
- **Performance Standards**: Does this feature affect TUI startup, queue operations, or download listing? If yes, confirm compliance with <500ms, <100ms, <100ms thresholds.
- **Error Handling**: Does this feature add new failure modes? If yes, define exit codes (0-4, 130) and retry policy.
- **Platform Support**: Does this feature work on Tier 1 platforms (macOS, Ubuntu LTS, Debian 12+)? If Tier 2/3 only, justify and document limitations.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
